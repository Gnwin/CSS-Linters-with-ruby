## Getting Started

**The project was designed to test capabilities of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby**
- **Ruby Enviroment**: if you do not have ruby installed, please visit this [link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install.

- **Terminal(Mac & Linux) or Command Prompt(Windows)**:
 - Clone the repository to your local machine with this command`$ https://github.com/Gnwin/Ruby-Linters.git`
 - Go to the bin file directory and locate the linter(lint) file.
 - In the Shell run ln -s $PWD/checker /usr/local/bin/ or sudo ln -s $PWD/checker /usr/local/bin/.
 - **NOTE**: If you have issues installing click [here](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) for guidelines.

- **Understanding the files and Content**
 - lint.rb : Main file which is responsible for running the application.
 - user_file.rb : Contains a User class that is responsible for reading the contents of CSS file provided by user.
 - css_checker.rb : Contains the CssChecker class that is responsible for checking the content of the CSS file provided by the user.
